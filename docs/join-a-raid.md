Any Raid Guild members or succesful cohort apprentices are eligible to join Raids. 

Before taking part in a Raid, most apprentices will have demonstrated their capability during a cohort project. 

If apprentices are experienced in a certain field, it’s possible to jump straight into client raids, but they will need to prove their experience to the cleric concerned. 

Raids are discussed on the cohort-voice channel and Raiding parties are formed at the weekly Raider Roundup Meetings ( Tuesdays 1pm EDT / 10am PST / 6pm UTC). During these meetings, clerics announce the client work that has been going on and apprentices and members will have a chance to contact the cleric to gain a position on the Raid. 

To get access to the cohort-voice channel apprentices will have to have successfully completed a cohort. 

One way to view the Raids underway is to check out [Dungeon Master](https://dungeonmaster.raidguild.org/raids). Dungeon Master is only available for those who are part of a cohort DAO or the Raid Guild DAO. 

Active Raids can be seen under the Raids channel. To join an existing Raid, please look for Guilders which are most active in the channel and shoot them a DM to discuss where you can add value.

We’d like to emphasize that jumping into a Raid without prior consent and context from existing members may be counterproductive, so please use the Raid channels and DM’s to get caught up to speed.

Seeing as the cost and budget of each Raid varies, please ensure that your expectations for payouts for completed tasks are discussed prior to work being performed.

For questions on how to price a given issue, please drop a note in #general.
