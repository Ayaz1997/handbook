## Haus Bot

This bot is operating on Raid Guild discord channels #dao-verified, #uh-notifications and #haus-of-daos for the convenience of DAO Haus and UBERHAUS in order to keep track of incoming member proposals. It contains variables such as:

- the name of the proposal
- a short description of the proposal
- the amount of member shares
- the tribute amount of WXDAI
- the funding amount
- the amount of loot shares

A link on the panel redirects you to the proposal on app.daohaus.club, where you can see all the details and the actions taken upon it.

It is a notification bot that announces new DAO summons & proposals

Three cheers to vengist#8655 for creating the bot.

## Sentry

Raid Guild‚Äôs Sentry bot handles Discord server verification and gatekeeping, sends automated notifications in internal channels, and works with slash commands and DMs to perform basic tasks.

**Guard Sentry** is the gatekeeper of Raid Guild‚Äôs Discord.

**Comrade Sentry** can return basic statistics on roles, current gas price, and current RAID price, and has member-only slash commands that are used to set up Raid and Camp channels.

**Minister Sentry** can pass on anonymous feedback. Add `whisper` as the first word of a DM to Minister Sentry to have anonymous feedback relayed into the <span class='channel'>üôä‚îÇwhispers</span> channel.

Read the [Raid Guild‚Äôs Sentry bot walkthrough](https://hackmd.io/@raidguild/SJdC7L4d5) for more details on the full functionality of Sentry bot and its slash commands.

Props to Saimano#0272 for making and maintaining the sentries.
