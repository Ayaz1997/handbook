## Apply for RIP Funding

Raid Guild Improvement Proposals, commonly referred to as “RIPs”, are an invaluable piece to ensuring that Raid Guild operates at its fullest capacity 24/7.  

RIPs are generally focused on Guild internal operations, but in some cases, RIPs have resulted in the Guild building open-source tools for the wider web3 ecosystem.  

[Smart Invoice](https://smartinvoice.xyz/) is a great example, as it began development as an internal tool for Raiders to set up an escrow for payment from their clients.  

If this excites you, we encourage you to keep reading! 

To receive funding for a Raid Guild Improvement Proposal (RIP), we suggest you [get a soft consensus from the DAO](./how-to-gain-consensus.md "How to Gain Consensus") before putting anything on chain. 

The best way to do this is as follows:

-   Create an issue on the [RIPs Repo](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RIP&template=rip-request.md&title=) detailing why it benefits the DAO and how it will be executed.
-   Add the new issue to the [RIP Requests](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/projects/1) Project (or ask a keeper).
-   Share that request in Discord under the <span class='channels'>#rip-discussion</span> Guild HQ channel.

By following these steps, your proposal will receive far more feedback and have a much higher chance of being passed.

If you don’t yet have the talent you need to execute the RIP, make sure to drop a link to your proposal along with a brief TL;DR to the <span class='channels'>#who-is-available</span> channel and outline the different roles you need for the RIP. Share the proposal during the weekly Roundtable for additional comments and feedback.

Once you have completed the preceding steps, double check to make sure you and your team have everything you need to make an official proposal to the DAO.

Refer to the process outlined on the [Proposal Types](./proposal-types.md) page for help to make proposal for funding for your RIP.
