Every week Raid Guild hosts a Weekly Roundtable where we introduce new members, provide Raid updates and discussion Raid Guild improvement ideas.

Roundtable calls are restricted to members only and occur every Thursday at 1PM EST (17:00 UTC).

If you have a share and would like an invite to the recurring Roundtable call, please drop a message in RaidHQ <span class='channels'>#general</span> channel so that someone can add you or just ask a @Tavern Keeper.
