A brief overview of how the Guild operates.

## Raid Guild

Our Guild is a Moloch V1 DAO. Its funds have been built from grants, member tributes, and raids. All members of the Guild have voting power over the Guild Bank, based on the amount of shares held. Members can earn more shares by completing Raids. Members can ragequit at any time.

RaidGuild is A Decentralized Collective of Mercenaries Ready to Slay Your Web3 Product Demons. Yet, we are even more than that, we are community built around a Moloch DAO, made up of members of many other communities.

We support the development of open-source tools for the good of the human experience. We beleive in the power of open-source to improve coordination and make a positive impact on the planet. Thus, we ship things that we beleive will help expand the use of open-source technologies, we work to create opportunties for expanding the audeince of P2P technologies such a Blockchains, DAO’s, etc.

We don’t just talk about cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies, we use them, build them, and share them with others everyday.

## Why Pledge, Where do My Funds Go ?

The reason that we ask members to pledge is to ensure that all members of the Guild have Skin-in-the-Game. The funds are used for internal RIP’s that any member can put up for a vote using the Discord channels and an on-chain vote. All proposal must receive support in the form of rough consensus before being put on-chain, any member will voting shares has the right to block a proposal if they disagree with the proposal or the use of those funds.

Since RaigGuild is a MolochDAO you are allowed to `RageQuit` your funds at any point in time without the approval of other members.
