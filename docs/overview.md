A brief overview of how the Guild operates.

## Raid Guild

RaidGuild is A Decentralized Collective of Mercenaries Ready to Slay Your Web3 Product Demons. Yet, we are even more than that, we are community built around a **[Moloch](https://www.molochdao.com/) V2 DAO migrated from V1**, made up of members of many other communities. Its funds have been built from grants, member tributes, and raids. All members of the Guild have voting power over the Guild Bank, based on the amount of shares held. Members can earn more shares by completing Raids & can `ragequit` at any time.

We support the development of open-source tools for the good of the human experience. We beleive in the power of open-source to improve coordination and make a positive impact on the planet. Thus, we ship things that we beleive will help expand the use of open-source technologies, we work to create opportunties for expanding the audeince of P2P technologies such a Blockchains, DAO’s, etc.

We don’t just talk about cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies, we use them, build them, and share them with others everyday.

## Why to Raid with the Guild ?

People join the Guild for many reasons, including but not limited to: access to more freelance work, jamming on code with other Web3 dreamers, beefing their Twitter bios, gaining access to the collective brain behind the Guild, tapping into a highly active group of interdisciplinary developers etc

You must decide whether you want to join the guild, we cannot convince you, nor will we try…

## How to join the Guild?

There are many ways into the Guild, surely more ways will arrise in the future as we expand. At present these are the easiest routes to become a member.

**Pledge:** To pledge you must purchase 10 DAO shares by heading to our Moloch DAO if your proposal is approved you’ll be granted the 10 shares you requested and become a full voting member.

**Apprentice:** To apprentice you must earn your way into the Guild picking up issues in the public channels marked #apprentice. Your contributions will be tracked and recorded until you reach the minimum amount to receive a single share. From there you will be expected to earn your remaining 9 shares through existing raids.

Members of the Guild play many roles read more about RaidGuild roles [here.](roles.md).

## Why Pledge, Where do My Funds Go ?

The reason that we ask members to pledge is to ensure that all members of the Guild have Skin-in-the-Game. The funds are used for internal RIP’s that any member can put up for a vote using the Discord channels and an on-chain vote. All proposal must receive support in the form of rough consensus before being put on-chain, any member with voting shares has the right to block a proposal if they disagree with the proposal or the use of those funds.

Since RaigGuild is a MolochDAO you are allowed to `RageQuit` your funds at any point in time without the approval of other members.
