There are many ways into the Guild, surely more ways will arrise in the future as we expand. At present these are the easiest routes to become a member.

**Pledge:** To pledge you must purchase 10 DAO shares by heading to our Moloch DAO if your proposal is approved you’ll be granted the 10 shares you requested and become a full voting member.

**Apprentice:** To apprentice you must earn your way into the Guild picking up issues in the public channels marked #apprentice. You’re contributions will be tracked and recorded until you reach the minimum amount to receive a single share. From there you will be expected to earn your remaining 9 shares through existing raids.

Members of the Guild play many roles read more about RaidGuild roles [here.](roles.md).
