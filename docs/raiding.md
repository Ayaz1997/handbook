A step by step procedure to start raiding.

## Starting an Internal Raid (RIP)
1. Look out for internal project signals or bring up your own ideas for the betterment of the Guild in _#RIP-Discussion_ or _#back-tavern_.
2. If there's interest, create a new channel under **Discussions category**. For example, _#rip-project-name_.
3. Discuss issues, requirements, funding and scope of the project.
4. Once there's enough signal from the members, move the channel from **Discussions** to **Active Raids** category.
5. Create funding proposals if necessary in [pokemol](https://pokemol.com/dao/0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d) and start working on.
6. Ship the product and create a proposal for shares/remaining funding if required.
7. Move the completed raid channel from **Active Raids** to **Crypt Closed Raids** category.

## Starting an External Client Raid (RAID)
1. Look for client submissions or client requests in _#client-submissions_ or _#client-arena_.
2. Create a new channel under **Discussions** category for further discussions. For example, _#client-project-name_.
3. Discuss issues, commitment, requirements, funding & scope of the project with the client.
4. If needed more developers or some other help, mention the [role](roles.md) required in _#who-is-available_.
5. Synthesize a *Raid Guild Proposal* and send to client.
6. If client accepts, inform _#treasury_, client has accepted the proposal.
7. The _#treasury_ creates **Multisig** for the Raid and invites party members working on it.
8. The _#treasury_ synthesizes a *Raid Guild Invoice* and sends to the client.
9.  When Client pays first invoice, all party members should request a withdraw of their proportion from the multisig.
10. Ship the product and complete the raid.
11. The _#treasury_ synthesizes a **Final Raid Guild Invoice** and sends to the client.
12. When client pays the final invoice, all party members should request a withdraw of their proportional loot from the multisig.
13. Create a proposal in [pokemol](https://pokemol.com/dao/0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d) for sending tributes to the Guild.
14. Move the completed raid channel from **Active Raids** category to **Closed Crypt Raids** category.
