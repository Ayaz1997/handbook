Once you are on the xDai bridge site, you will see the amount of Dai you have on Ethereum Mainnet as well as the amount of xDAi that you have available on xDai Chain. (You can easily navigate between xDai side chain and Ethereum Mainnet if you click on the networks tab your Metamask Wallet)

### Step 3:
