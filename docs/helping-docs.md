### Step 2:
Visit https://dai-bridge.poa.network/

Once you are on the xDai bridge site, you will see the amount of Dai you have on Ethereum Mainnet as well as the amount of xDAi that you have available on xDai Chain. (You can easily navigate between xDai side chain and Ethereum Mainnet if you click on the networks tab your Metamask Wallet)

### Step 3:
In order to swap your Mainnet Dai for xDai, you need to be connected to Ethereum Mainnet. If you want to swap your xDai for Dai, you need to be connectec to xDai Side chain.

**To swap your tokens enter the amount you are looking to swap and hit “transfer”.**
… And just like that, you have your xDai on xDai Side Chain

## Spoils and Getting more shares

### Raid party - 10%
10% of total invoice goes to spoils (direct payment to the guild)

example: Raid party is paid 1000DAI for first milestone, 100DAI goes to the guild and 900DAI is distributed to raid party members.

reason: The guild has provided value by creating the network.

### Member - up to 20%
Has the option to buy shares as what we call ‘proof of contribution’. This is up to 20% of what was paid

example: member was paid 1000DAI for their work in a raid. The member can now buy up to 200DAI worth of shares. A share always costs .1weth/1share

reason: the only way to get more shares, outside of initial membership of ten shares is to buy more shares. Because you are buying shares, and not being gifted shares, you are not diluting the other members. 20% is the max so the overall number of total shares does not balloon too quickly.

### Special Case (Consultation) - 50/50
Consultation payments go directly to the dao (300DAI). The member that did the consult can claim 50% of that as shares. So if .1weth is 30DAI they can claim 150DAI worth of shares or 150/30 = 5 shares. If more than one person helps in the consult that can be split.

reason: the main point of a consultation is to close a deal with a client. On project payment milestones the client manager will be getting 10% of the total payment.
For what ever reason, all consultations do not result in a deal. so the funds for the consult is split 50/50. 50% to the guild and 50% shares for client manager.
