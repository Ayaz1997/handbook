Discord is the central point of communication for all things Raid Guild.

You can join the Discord here, and will be assigned an **Apprentice** role to start. As you level up in the DAO, you’ll unlock new private channels to take on bigger Raids and contribute to shaping the Guild as we know it today.

### Getting Started

This first place you’ll want to make yourself known is #Tavern - where you can introduce yourself, your hobbies and your strengths.

From here, you’ll want to start earning some rep in the Guild by tackling open Apprentice issues in the #apprentice-good-first-issues channel.

You’ll notice there are a few #apprentice channels where you can meet and interact with other Guilders, making your presence heard in the Raid Guild Ether.

Long story short, you’ll need to work your way into the Guild, so the more issues you tackle to improve the Guild, the quicker you’ll receive a share! (and become part of the Guild).

### Roles

Just as with any strong Discord, we use Roles to showcase different skill sets. These Roles are used to Summon Guilders for different Raids, and should only be assigned if you can be called upon to complete the necessary tasks associated with each of them.

* Apprentice (New Applicants) -  Those applying to join the DAO.
* Angry Dwarf (Treasury) - Accounting, finance specialist.
* Archer (Design) - Artists, graphic design, illustrators.
* Bard (Marketing) - Signal, communication, growth hacking
* Cleric (Account manager) - Hybrid comms/project manager who collects client payments
* Druid (Data Science/Analytics) - Researchers, onchain analysis, SEO
* Healer (Internal ops) - HR type/fixers, internal coordination.
* Hunter (BizDev) - Sales and business development.
* Paladin (Backend Dev) - Java, Python, Rust dev etc.
* Monk (PM) - Manager, budgeting, international Raid communication
* Mystic Alchemist (DAO Consultant) - Expert DAO user, advisor, consultant.
* Necromancer (DevOps) - Technology configuration and optimization.
* Ranger (UX/User Testing) - User experience and feedback, testing expert.
* Rogue (Legal) - Attorney, legal advisors/analysts, etc
* Scribe (Content Creator) - Blog posts, video, podcast.
* Tavern Keeper (Community) - Community management (Discord), operations, evangelism.
* Warrior (Front end) - React, CSS, HTML etc
* Wizard (Smart Contracts) - Solidity, C++ devs etc

Notice a role (or skill) we’re missing? Suggest a new one in the #ops channel and if you get soft consensus deploy it ! 


As it stands today, Guilders holding at least one share can assign themselves any role they see fit. Please do not overassign yourself in order to give those who are highly skilled in specific areas the chance to shine. We recommend assigning a maximum of 5 roles to start and branching outwards over time.

The larger vision is that your player card will follow you from community to community within the Meta-Ecosystem (MetaCartel/MetaGame/RaidGuild)!

### Categories

Within the Raid Guild Discord, you’ll notice a suite of Categories each full of different sub-channels. Here’s what you need to know about each.

#### Public
Public channels are available to everyone in the Discord. This offers a crossing ground for Apprentices and Guilders and is largely recreational. Guilders should keep a close eye on #apprentice-good-first-issues as this is where Apprentices are earning their chops and contributing to better refine the Guild.

#Tavern = Welcome messages, small talk, basic Q & A.
#Memes,#Learning = Crowdsourcing interesting,funny, thought provoking content from our community.
#Apprentice Lobby, #good-first-issues, #show-n-tell = a place for new applicants to congregate, chat, pick-up issues, ask questions, show their skills/previous accomplishments.

#### Battlefield

A place for Guilders to chat with one another about general Raid questions and feedback, discuss Client submissions and find new Guilders to form a Raid Party. If you’re looking for people to help you on your Raid, Battlefield is a great first place to start.

#Dev, #Design = Domain specific questions for members only.
#Back-Tavern = Internal chat for members only, ideas, thoughts, questions.
#Client Submissions = Data from client requests on Airtable [form](https://raidguild.org/hire) dropped into this channel.
#Who-is-avaliable = Mention a @role here for finding team members to jump on new raid opportunities.


#### Guild HQ

HQ is where we discuss Raid Guild improvements. From championing new members to enhanced operations and treasury management, Guild HQ is where you’ll look when chatting about anything to help make Raid Guild better than it is today.

Got an idea for how to improve Raid Guild with an internal Raid? Check out #rip-discussion to make a Raid Improvement Proposal (RIP) and get feedback and soft consensus form other Guilders.
#Announcements = Bot drops new member proposals, things that require DAO member visibility.
#RIP-Discussion = RaidGuild Internal Improvements are things we fund internal for the good of the Guild.
#Champions = Where we promote new applicants to the existing members of the Guild.
#General = Requesting feedback, gathering support on an idea, vetting a potential raid.
#Ops = Internal operations, projects, promotions of the Guild.
#Props, #Did-a-thing = promote someone who did awesome work, share something awesome you did for the Guild.
#Shill = retweets/likes for our twitter/medium articles.

#### Raids

This is where all active Raids are listed. You will notice each subchannel starts with #raid signalling it is an ongoing engagement. Each Raid is given a unique name and a pinned message which describes what the Raid is about.

Keen to get involved with a given Raid? Kinda slide through the subchannel and politely ask where you can add value. More times than not Raids can always use an extra hand!

#### Client Chat

As we sort out an engagement with a client, we may open a Client Chat subchannel to discuss the scope and figure out exactly what is needed. Client chats are a great way to get some visibility into who’s on the other side of a Raid, and their tone, expectations and budget for an ongoing Raid.

Not all Raids have a Client Chat in Discord, as many times this happens outside of Discord on platforms like Telegram. Please respect that all Client Chats are proprietary and that any information taken from Client Chats and used maliciously may result in a permanent banning from Raid Guild.

#### Crypt Closed Raids

Archived Raid channels that have been closed out. Learn more about when it’s time to close a Raid using How To Close a Raid

### Navigating Discord

There’s a lot going on in our Discord. Please never hesitate to ask questions if you get lost. The best place to do so is in #Tavern as an Apprentice or in #general or #ops as a Guilder.

If you have yet to receive a response about your Discord question, search by the **@Tavern Keeper Role** and ping them along with your question.
