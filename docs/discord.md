Discord is the central point of communication for all things Raid Guild.

You can join the Discord here, and will be assigned an **Apprentice** role to start. As you level up in the DAO, you’ll unlock new private channels to take on bigger Raids and contribute to shaping the Guild as we know it today.

### Getting Started

This first place you’ll want to make yourself known is <span class='channels'>#Tavern</span> - where you can introduce yourself, your hobbies and your strengths.

From here, you’ll want to start earning some rep in the Guild by tackling open Apprentice issues in the <span class='channels'>#apprentice-good-first-issues</span> channel.

You’ll notice there are a few <span class='channels'>#apprentice channels</span> where you can meet and interact with other Guilders, making your presence heard in the Raid Guild Ether.

Long story short, you’ll need to work your way into the Guild, so the more issues you tackle to improve the Guild, the quicker you’ll receive a share! (and become part of the Guild).

### Roles

Just as with any strong Discord, we use Roles to showcase different skill sets. These Roles are used to Summon Guilders for different Raids, and should only be assigned if you can be called upon to complete the necessary tasks associated with each of them.

### Developer Roles

Notice a role (or skill) we’re missing? Suggest a new one in the #ops channel and if you get soft consensus deploy it !

As it stands today, Guilders holding at least one share can assign themselves any role they see fit. Please do not overassign yourself in order to give those who are highly skilled in specific areas the chance to shine. We recommend assigning a maximum of 5 roles to start and branching outwards over time.

The larger vision is that your player card will follow you from community to community within the Meta-Ecosystem (MetaCartel/MetaGame/RaidGuild)!

### Categories

Within the Raid Guild Discord, you’ll notice a suite of Categories each full of different sub-channels. Here’s what you need to know about each.

#### Public

Public channels are available to everyone in the Discord. This offers a crossing ground for Apprentices and Guilders and is largely recreational. Guilders should keep a close eye on <span class='channels'>#apprentice-good-first-issues</span> as this is where Apprentices are earning their chops and contributing to better refine the Guild.

#### Guild HQ

HQ is where we discuss Raid Guild improvements. From championing new members to enhanced operations and treasury management, Guild HQ is where you’ll look when chatting about anything to help make Raid Guild better than it is today.

Got an idea for how to improve Raid Guild with an internal Raid? Check out <span class='channels'>#rip-discussion</span> to make a Raid Improvement Proposal (RIP) and get feedback and soft consensus form other Guilders.

| Name              | Visibility   | Purpose                                                                                |

#### Active Raids

This is where all active Raids are listed. You will notice each subchannel starts with <span class='channels'>#raid</span> signalling it is an ongoing engagement. Each Raid is given a unique name and a pinned message which describes what the Raid is about.

Keen to get involved with a given Raid? Kinda slide through the subchannel and politely ask where you can add value. More times than not Raids can always use an extra hand!

| Name                          | Visibility   | Purpose                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _#[raid-project/rip-project]_ | Members Only | Projects you’re working on go here. Each channel requires a pinned message so other members know what the raid entails. |

#### Client Chats

As we sort out an engagement with a client, we may open a Client Chat subchannel to discuss the scope and figure out exactly what is needed. Client chats are a great way to get some visibility into who’s on the other side of a Raid, and their tone, expectations and budget for an ongoing Raid.

Not all Raids have a Client Chat in Discord, as many times this happens outside of Discord on platforms like Telegram. Please respect that all Client Chats are proprietary and that any information taken from Client Chats and used maliciously may result in a permanent banning from Raid Guild.

| Name                | Visibility   | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| _#[client-project]_ | Members Only | Client and team discussions before starting the raid. |

#### Crypt Closed Raids

Archived Raid channels that have been closed out. Learn more about when it’s time to close a Raid using How To Close a Raid.

### Navigating Discord

There’s a lot going on in our Discord. Please never hesitate to ask questions if you get lost. The best place to do so is in <span class='channels'>#Tavern</span> as an Apprentice or in <span class='channels'>#general</span> or <span class='channels'>#ops</span> as a Guilder.

If you have yet to receive a response about your Discord question, search by the **@Tavern Keeper** Role and ping them along with your question. If you do not receive a response form a @Tavern Keeper, feel free to DM them. However, we encourage all questions to remain in public channels for future conversations and reference.
