A step by step procedure for new members to join the Guild.

## OnBoard as an Apprentice

1. Fill out the **Join** form at [Raid Guild](https://raidguild.org).
2. Join the [Guild Discord](https://discord.gg/PvWe9JD) and introduce yourself in the _#apprentice-lobby_.
3. Showcase your past work and skills in _#show-n-tell_.
4. Look out for issues to work on in _#good-first-issues_ to earn reputation.
5. Once you prove yourself with the skills and reputation, a member of the Guild will signal your onboarding.
6. Submit a **new member proposal** for **1 Share with 0 Tribute** in [Pokemol](https://pokemol.com/dao/0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d).
7. Once the proposal passes, you will be given access to member alone channels.
8. For the remaining **9 shares** to get yourself promoted from an **Apprentice** to **Member**, you need to work on a **raid or a bounty** depending on the availability.
9. A Member will oversee your progress and once it's done, you will be championed in _#Champions_ as a signal for your remaining 9 share proposal.
10. Submit a **new member proposal** for **9 Share with 0 Tribute** in [Pokemol](https://pokemol.com/dao/0xbeb3e32355a933501c247e2dbde6e6ca2489bf3d).
