Raid Guild grows organically, adding new members as individual existing members deem appropriate and champion them in. The championing process relies both on the champion being a good judge of who is a good fit for the Guild as well as on the champion’s reputation within the Guild being at stake.

That has previously worked quite well when the Guild was smaller and it was easier for everyone in the Guild to evaluate new members once championed. But as we grow and that becomes more difficult, we risk a drop-off in the quality of our new members.

There are two pipeline where new members can originate from:

1) Raid Guild cohorts; i.e. applicant onboarding
2) Off-the-street; i.e. member reference

Raid Guild has instituted an onboarding process through the utilization of Cohorts, you can see how Raid Guild introduced Season0 participants to the Guild [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vU5Qu_n-THe_qcRfO8blVSjb_nxPNpn3m7DxnkAAUek/edit#slide=id.gbcc4521e42_0_7). 

Alternatively, new member can be onboarded directly "off the street" but current members. This page describes how cohort participants or off-the-street applications can be championed by a Raid Guild member

The TL;DR: 
   * Champions must stake $RAID to sponsor a new member.
   * If the new member is successful, the champion gets their stake back plus additional $RAID as a reward

## Success Criteria

New members are successful when they contribute to the Raid Guild community, bring in value to the Guild, and earn income for themselves.

Within the first two months (60 days) after their membership proposal is processed, new members should:

1. Successfully join at least 1 raid or RIP
    * Includes completed raids/RIPs as well as raids/RIPs still in progress (provided that the new member is in good standing on that project)
2. Attend at least 2 Guild meetings
    * Includes Roundtable and Raider Roundup
3. Demonstrate shared values with the Guild
    * This is at the discretion of the Guild

### Reward

If the new member meets the criteria from the previous section, the champion is also eligible for a reward of Y $RAID.

This reward creates an incentive for the champion to support the new member, help them understand how things work, get included in a new raid or RIP, etc.

Alternatively, the champion is free to contract with another member to serve as the new member’s “buddy”. The champion receives the reward, but can share it with anybody who helps mentor the new member.

## Stake

### Full stake for “off the street” applicants: X = 50,000 $RAID

> currently valued at ~$3k

the idea here is create a big enough downside that champions think very hard about who they want to champion into the guild. Current members should not champion new members if they’re not confident they’ll get their stake back, ie they’re not confident the new member will be active and a good fit for the guild.

Half stake for applicants who have gone through a cohort: X / 2 = 25,000 $RAID

> currently valued at ~$1.5k

cohort applicants are much more likely to be aligned with the guild and have more exposure to current members. Less reliance on champion to make the right decision means a lower stake is required
champion may not be from the same cohort; if so, full stake required

### Reward

Y = 25,000 $RAID

> currently valued at ~$1.5k

the idea here is to create a positive incentive large enough to make it worthwhile for a current member to spend time mentoring the new member
the upper limit on this reward amount is the value that the guild places on new members
