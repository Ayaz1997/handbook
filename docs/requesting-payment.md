### Requesting Payment

If you're requesting funding from Raid Guild for a RIP, or payment has been made to the Guild for a Raid, and you would like to request payment be made in shares or loot, you'll want to put up a funding proposal requesting the proportional amount owed to you based off your agreement with your Raid Party.  

It is important to note that you can request up to 20% of your payment be made in the form of voting shares, and the remaining amount can be requested in Loot or any token that has been whitelisted by the Raid Guild DAO.
