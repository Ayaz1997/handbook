To become a Member, you will need to be Championed by an existing Raid Guild Member. This can be seen in the Guild HQ <span class='channels'>#champions</span> channel and will be brought up during RoundTable by the Member looking to champion you.

Please note that all new members are capped at 100 Shares for 500 wxDAI.

Once you’ve received 100 Shares, you’ll be given access to member-exclusive channels and are bestowed with great responsibility to uphold our code of conduct.
