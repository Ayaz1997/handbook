You can join the Raid Guild Discord [here](https://discord.gg/RWjkQ6DNnv). When you have been assigned a “Raid Guild Member” role, then you will be able to access all of Raid Guild’s internal channels. 

If you are **not** a Raid Guild member, we recommend you check out “[Become An Apprentice](https://handbook.raidguild.org/docs/become-an-apprentice)” first.  If admitted to the Raid Guild as an apprentice, you’ll have the opportunity to prove your talent and level up in the DAO as you complete tasks, unlocking access to new private channels.  This will allow you to take on bigger Raids and contribute to shaping the Guild as we know it today.
