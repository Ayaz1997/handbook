> We use D&D roles, for real life!

The roles we currently have are decided upon in the DAO member channels through rough consensus TL:DR ask for forgiveness not permission.

Roles came about as a way for members to delinate between skillsets, since RaidGuild is about forming and shipping Web3 projects we need to know what everyone is capable of so we can form diverse teams that actually ship cool shit!

The larger vision for roles is that your player card (WIP) with your _roles/skills, badges/NFTâ€™s, XP/CRED, DAO memberships_ would follow you from community to community within the Meta-Ecosystem (**[MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/) | [MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf/) | [RaidGuild](https://raidguild.org/)**) more on that later.
