## Find your place

### Discord

Most of Raid Guild’s business happens on our Discord server. 

Join using [this link](https://discord.com/invite/rGFpfQf) and explore the channels. Read the [channel guides]((./discord-channels)) for reference. 

Members have access to all the channels. Others – successful cohort members, newcomers, clients – will have access to fewer channels. 

We ask that users of our Discord server keep it polite. Please read our notes on [Discord Etiquette](./discord-etiquette).
